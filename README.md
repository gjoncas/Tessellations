# Tessellations

These are repeating tile patterns made with Tiùëòz, and possibly Haskell later on.
<br>I use these for report covers, which is why they are letter size (8.5√ó11).

For now, this repository is private, since nice typesetting is a large part of my value-added.
<br>The main purpose of this repository is to have all these designs in one place.

If I get ambitious, I'd like to explore aperiodic tiling, Voronoi diagrams, and the math of tessellations.
